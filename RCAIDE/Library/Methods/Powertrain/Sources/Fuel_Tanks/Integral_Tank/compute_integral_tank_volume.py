def compute_fuselage_integral_tank_fuel_volume(fuel_tank,fuselage):
    """
    Computes the fuel volume for an integral fuel tank within a fuselage structure.

    This function calculates the volume of fuel that can be stored in an integral tank
    located between two fuselage segments. The calculation assumes a truncated cone
    geometry between the inner and outer segments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fuel_tank : Fuel_Tank
        The fuel tank object containing fuel properties and mass characteristics
    fuselage : Fuselage
        The fuselage object containing segment geometry and positioning data

    Returns
    -------
    volume : float
        The calculated fuel volume in cubic meters

    Notes
    -----
    The function iterates through fuselage segments to find adjacent segments where
    the inner segment has a fuel tank. The volume calculation uses the truncated
    cone formula for the space between two elliptical cross-sections.

    **Major Assumptions**
        * Fuel tank spans exactly between two adjacent fuselage segments
        * Fuselage cross-sections are elliptical
        * Fuel density is uniform throughout the tank

    **Theory**

    The volume of a truncated cone is calculated using:

    :math:`V = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( A_1 + A_2 + \\sqrt{A_1 A_2} \\right) h`

    where:
        - :math:`A_1` is the area of the inner segment cross-section
        - :math:`A_2` is the area of the outer segment cross-section  
        - :math:`h` is the height (length) between segments

    **Definitions**

        A fuel tank that is built into the structure of the aircraft rather than being a separate container

    'Truncated Cone'

    """
    Computes the fuel volume for an integral fuel tank within a wing structure.

    This function calculates the volume of fuel that can be stored in an integral tank
    within the wing. It handles both single-segment and multi-segment wing configurations,
    updating the fuel tank's mass properties and center of gravity accordingly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fuel_tank : Fuel_Tank
        The fuel tank object containing fuel properties and mass characteristics
    wing : Wing
        The wing object containing segment geometry, airfoil data, and fuel tank specifications

    Returns
    -------
    volume : float
        The calculated fuel volume in cubic units

    Notes
    -----
    The function determines the fuel tank origin from the wing origin and calculates
    volume based on whether the wing has multiple segments or is a single segment.
    For multi-segment wings, it iterates through adjacent segments to find fuel tank
    locations and accumulates moments of inertia.

    **Major Assumptions**
        * Fuel tank geometry follows the wing's airfoil profile
        * Fuel density is uniform throughout the tank
        * Wing segments are properly connected and oriented

    **Theory**

    For multi-segment wings, the volume is calculated segment by segment using
    truncated prism geometry. The center of gravity is computed as a weighted
    average of segment centers.

    'Integral Wing Tank'
        A fuel tank built into the wing structure, typically within the wing box

    ensure the fuel tank doesn't interfere with the airfoil surface. Defaults to using a
    NACA 0012 airfoil if no airfoil is provided.

    **Major Assumptions**
        * Airfoil geometry is available and properly defined
        * Fuel tank chord locations are within the airfoil bounds
        * Linear interpolation is sufficient for coordinate determination

    **Definitions**

    'Non-dimensional Coordinates'
        Coordinates normalized by the chord length (x/c, y/c)

    'Rib Location'
        The position along the chord where the fuel tank front and rear boundaries are located

    'Clearance'
        The minimum distance between the fuel tank boundary and the airfoil surface

def induced_drag(state,settings,geometry):
    """Determines induced drag for the full aircraft

    Assumptions:
    This function operates in one of three ways:
       -An oswald efficiency is provided. All induced drag, inviscid and viscous, is use calculated using that factor
       -A span efficiency is provided. The inviscid induced drag is calculated from that. Viscous induced drag is
            calculated using the viscous_lift_dependent_drag_factor, K, and the parasite drag.
       -The inviscid induced drag from the the lift calculation for each wing, usually a vortex lattice, is used. Viscous induced drag is
            calculated using the viscous_lift_dependent_drag_factor, K, and the parasite drag.
            
        The last two options do not explicitly provide for the case where the fuselage produces an induced drag directly.

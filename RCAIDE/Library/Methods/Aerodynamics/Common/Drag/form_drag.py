    Notes
    -----
    This function calculates the form drag coefficient based on angle of attack and Mach number
    effects. The calculation accounts for separation drag on wing segments and applies Mach
    number corrections for compressibility effects. The form drag is blended between subsonic
    and supersonic regimes using a cubic spline.
    
    **Major Assumptions**
        * Form drag is primarily due to wing geometry and angle of attack
        * Separation drag follows polynomial correlation with angle of attack
        * Mach number correction is valid for typical transport aircraft
        * Vertical tail contributions are negligible
        * Cubic spline blending smooths transition between flight regimes
    
    **Theory**

    The Mach number correction factor is:

    :math:`M_{correction} = 2.9788 M^3 - 6.4381 M^2 + 4.4967 M`

    where :math:`M` is the freestream Mach number.

    The separation drag coefficient follows a polynomial correlation:

    :math:`C_{D,sep} = (111.41 \\alpha^4 - 16.569 \\alpha^3 + 1.8 \\alpha^2 - 0.0242 \\alpha + 0.0015) \\cdot M_{correction}`

    where :math:`\\alpha` is the angle of attack in radians.

    For wings with segments, the total form drag is:

    :math:`C_{D,form,wing} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} C_{D,sep,i} \\cdot S_{ref,i}`

    where :math:`S_{ref,i}` is the reference area of segment :math:`i`.

    For wings without segments:

    :math:`C_{D,form,wing} = C_{D,sep} \\cdot S_{ref,wing}`

    The total form drag coefficient is:

    :math:`C_{D,form} = \\frac{\\sum C_{D,form,wing}}{S_{ref}} \\cdot h_{00}(M)`

    where :math:`h_{00}(M)` is the cubic spline blending function.
    
    **Definitions**

        Drag component caused by pressure differences due to flow separation and body shape.
    
    'Separation Drag'
        Additional drag caused by boundary layer separation from the surface.
    
    'Cubic Spline Blending'
        Smooth transition function between subsonic and supersonic aerodynamic regimes.

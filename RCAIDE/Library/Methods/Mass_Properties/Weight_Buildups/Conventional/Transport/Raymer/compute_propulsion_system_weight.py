    Notes
    -----
    This method calculates the complete propulsion system weight including engines,
    nacelles, fuel system, and all supporting systems using Raymer's correlations.

    **Major Assumptions**
        * Correlations based on conventional turbofan/turbojet installations
        * Engine controls scale with number of engines and fuselage length
        * Nacelle weight includes thrust reversers if applicable
        * Fuel system weight scales with fuel capacity and number of tanks
        * Starter weight scales with total engine weight

    **Theory**
    Key component weights are calculated using:
    .. math::
        W_{nacelle} = 0.6724K_{ng}L_n^{0.1}W_n^{0.294}N_{ult}^{0.119}W_{ec}^{0.611}N_{eng}^{0.984}S_n^{0.224}

    .. math::
        W_{fuel\_sys} = 1.07W_{fuel}^{0.58}N_{eng}^{0.43}M_{max}^{0.34}

    .. math::
        W_{engine} = 0.084BPR^{1.1}W_{eng}^{0.5}N_{eng}^{0.5}

    .. math::
        W_{engine\_controls} = 5N_{eng} + 0.8L_{eng}

    .. math::
        W_{starter} = 49.19\left(\frac{W_{eng}}{1000}\right)^{0.541}
    
    where:
        * :math:`K_{ng}` is a factor for the engine mount type
        * :math:`L_n` is the length of the nacelle
        * :math:`W_n` is the diameter of the nacelle
        * :math:`N_{ult}` is the ultimate load factor
        * :math:`W_{ec}` is the engine control weight
        * :math:`N_{eng}` is the number of engines
        * :math:`BPR` is the bypass ratio
        * :math:`W_{eng}` is the dry engine weight
        * :math:`L_{eng}` is the length of the engine
        * :math:`N_{eng}` is the number of engines
        * :math:`W_{fuel}` is the fuel weight
        * :math:`M_{max}` is the maximum Mach number
        * :math:`S_n` is the nacelle surface area
